**Problem**:
{task}

**Agent Roles**:
{role_list}

**Step 1: Initial Paths**
Each agent generates a unique solution. Generate {num_paths} distinct solutions. Label them Path {', '.join(path_labels[:num_paths])}.

**Step 2: Self-Roast**
Each path critiques its own limitations with brutal honesty:
- What assumptions might be wrong?
- Where could this approach fail?
- What important aspects are missing?

**Step 3: Mutual Roast**
Each path critiques the other paths, focusing on:
- Formal clarity and logical structure
- Completeness of reasoning
- Implementability and practicality
- Alignment with best practices

**Step 4: Refine**
Each path produces a refined version based on all critiques. Do this for {rounds} rounds.
Label refined paths as:
- Round 1: {', '.join([f'{label}2' for label in path_labels[:num_paths]])}
- Round 2: {', '.join([f'{label}3' for label in path_labels[:num_paths]])}
{"- Round 3: " + ', '.join([f'{label}4' for label in path_labels[:num_paths]]) if rounds >= 3 else ""}

**Step 5: Converge**
Use the following strategy to select the final answer: **{strategy.upper()}**

- If 'MERGE': Synthesize the best elements from all refined paths into a Super Path
- If 'VOTE': Select the strongest individual refined path and explain why
- If 'SCORE': Evaluate each refined path on accuracy, clarity, and completeness, then pick the highest scorer

**Final Output**:
Return a clearly written final solution. Label it as "FINAL RESULT" and ensure it represents the best collaborative thinking of all agents.

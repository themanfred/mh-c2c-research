**You are an AI agent implementing the “Critique-to-Consensus 2.0” (C2C) algorithm.**  
Your external scoring function **S(c)** measures the quality of any candidate solution _c_ (e.g. accuracy, log-likelihood under a held-out model, or a human-style rating).

---

**Task**  
Explain your problem in one or two sentences.

**Scoring function S(c)**  
For example, the log-probability assigned by GPT-4 to the reasoning chain.

**Hyperparameters**  
*(to be chosen by you)*  
- **Maximum rounds** _T_ (e.g. 5)  
- **Inverse temperature** β (e.g. 1.0)  
- **Convergence threshold** ε (e.g. 0.01)

---

### Procedure

1. **Initialization**  
   - Generate an initial candidate solution, _c_.  
   - Compute _S_prev_ ← S(c).

2. **Iterative Refinement**  
   Repeat for _t_ = 1 … _T_:

   a. **Proposal**  
   > “How can I improve the current solution?”  
   → Produce a refined proposal _c_prop_.

   b. **Score Difference**  
   ΔS = S(c_prop) − S(c)

c. **Acceptance Probability**  
d. **Accept or Reject**  
- With probability α, set _c_ ← _c_prop_.  
- Otherwise, keep the old _c_.

e. **Convergence Check**  
- If |S(c) − S_prev| < ε, break.  
- Else, set _S_prev_ ← S(c) and continue.

3. **Return Final Answer**  
- Output the current _c_ as your final solution.  
- Report its score S(c).
